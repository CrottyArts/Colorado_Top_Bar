Attached are a series of 6 Files that we created to cut the Colorado Top Bar Hive on a smaller scale CNC Machine (max size 
1000mm x 600mm)

The files contain all the origional layers from design file Version 5.4. 
They are only redistributed to fit 3 @ 1000x600mm and 3 @ 1000 x 500mm.
Files were prepared for both 19mm board and 21mm board.  
All shapes have been joined to allow for easier selection and assignment within the cutting program.
